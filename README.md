# Text Summarization

## Overview

This project involves developing a text summarization model that can automatically generate concise and coherent summaries from large blocks of text. The model leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models with attention mechanisms, to produce summaries that capture the essence of the original text.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of articles and their corresponding summaries. Popular datasets for text summarization include:

- **CNN/Daily Mail Dataset:** Contains news articles paired with multi-sentence summaries.
- **XSum Dataset:** A more abstractive summarization dataset with single-sentence summaries.

The dataset used in this project should be preprocessed and tokenized before feeding it into the model.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-summarization.git
   cd text-summarization
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory if it's not already included.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is crucial for preparing the text data for summarization:

- **Text Cleaning:** Removing special characters, stopwords, and converting text to lowercase.
- **Tokenization:** Splitting the text into individual tokens (words).
- **Padding:** Ensuring all sequences (articles and summaries) have the same length by padding shorter sequences.
- **Vocabulary Building:** Creating a vocabulary of the most frequent words in the dataset.

## Modeling

The text summarization model is built using a sequence-to-sequence architecture with attention mechanisms:

1. **Encoder:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer-based model that encodes the input text into a fixed-size context vector.
2. **Attention Mechanism:** Allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence during generation.
3. **Decoder:** Another RNN or transformer model that generates the summary from the context vector produced by the encoder.
4. **Training:** The model is trained on pairs of articles and their corresponding summaries, using teacher forcing and minimizing the cross-entropy loss.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** Measures the overlap between the generated summary and the reference summary.
  - **ROUGE-N:** Measures the overlap of n-grams.
  - **ROUGE-L:** Measures the longest common subsequence.
- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):** Another metric that compares the overlap of n-grams in the generated and reference summaries.

## Results

- The model achieved a **ROUGE-1** score of **X%** and a **BLEU** score of **Y** on the test dataset.
- The generated summaries are coherent and capture the main ideas of the articles, with a balance between abstraction and extractive summarization.

*Note: Replace **X%** and **Y** with the actual results obtained from your model.*

## Future Work

- **Model Improvements:** Explore more advanced architectures like transformers and pre-trained models such as BART or T5 for better summarization quality.
- **Abstractive Summarization:** Focus on generating more abstractive summaries that rephrase the original text rather than just extracting sentences.
- **Evaluation Enhancements:** Experiment with human evaluation to assess the quality of the summaries beyond automated metrics.
